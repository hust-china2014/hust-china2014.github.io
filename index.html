                <h1>Background</h1>
                <p class="paragraphs" id="sec1_p1">　Targeted delivery of drugs plays a significant role in the treatment of disease. In various cases, we can’t achieve the expected efficacy or even introduced some serious side effects just because the drug can’t be transported directionally. To solve this problem, we engineered an intelligent delivery system which can be magnetically controlled and has the ability to identify specific cells. We call it "The Nano-ship of Maritime Silk-Road".Just like the ancient Chinese ship on the maritime silk road transporting china and tea to the world, our nanoship,will carry treatment material to its final targets no matter how hard it is. In order to achieve this goal of having a better targeting capabilities than single nano-magnetic spheres, We have designed a flagellum-like nano-magnetic spheres string for Nano-ship to drive.</p>
                <p class="paragraphs" id="sec1_p2">　Our "Nano-ship" is like a little clever tadpole, which consists of a round head and a linear tail. The head is made up of the substances that need to be transported and we can give it special identification function by molecular modification. Scaffold-stranded DNA will self-assembled into a tube which is the main body of the tail. And it stretched out several single-stranded DNA as designed to connect the Fe3O4 nano-magnetic spheres and the head. Therefore, the self-assembled tail can swing autonomously in an alternating magnetic field and provide the power for the "Nano-ship" to move towards a certain direction. In the experiment, we used a nano-gold sphere which is modified with DNA oligonucleotide probes to be the head of "Nano-ship" .The probe on the nano-gold sphere not only connect to the designed position of the tail but also complete aptamers：an oligonucleotide probe that has the function of specifically recognizing cancer cells.  Meanwhile the tissue penetration ability and unique role in the destruction effect of cells are highlights of our structure. Our "nano-ship" structure can also be applied to orientation to the efficient delivery of material such as antibody, small synthetic molecules, DNA molecular cages, etc.
                    We hope this "Nano-ship" transport platform can be applied to cancer treatment and many other fields to demonstrate its broad application prospects. destruction effect of cells are highlights of our structure.
